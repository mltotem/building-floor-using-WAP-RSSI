Classification of supervised dataset to predict building/floor location of subject

Needs more data exploration to compare relationship between features and target variable, and among the features.

In this case the dataset came biased by splitting already into a test and training set. Need to review articles out there about the types of biases and how to deal with them.
Accuracy was the only metric used, precision/recall/F1 may be options.
